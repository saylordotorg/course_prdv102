**Unit 2: The Key Components of a Resume and Cover Letter** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Now that you have an understanding of the basic function of a
professional resume, you can focus on the key components of a resume in
greater detail.  In this unit, you will study the kinds of content and
categories often included on a resume and learn how the arrangement of
these components can change based on the information and accomplishments
you wish to emphasize to a potential employer.  You will consider which
categories you would like to include on your own resume, and then you
will draft your resume by listing your major accomplishments,
professional skills, and other pertinent information in an organized
manner under these categories.  In addition, you will draft a cover
letter to accompany your resume.  Finally, you will explore some common
design elements frequently used on a resume and learn about simple
techniques for effectively formatting and styling a resume.  By doing
so, you will lay the groundwork for polishing your resume in Unit 3.*
