    Link: Penn State University: Joe Schall’s *Style for Students
    Online*: [“Chapter 8:
    Resumes”](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/styleforstudents/c8.html)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This chapter describes an effective resume as
    “…principally an objective summary of your skills and achievements,
    secondly a subtly clever argument that you are worth hiring, and
    finally a reflection of your individuality.”    Click on the link
    above to access “Chapter 8: Resumes.”  Read the introduction, and
    then click on “Writing the Conventional Resume” to read the
    chapter.  This chapter describes several types of resumes and offers
    samples of each type.  You might be asked, for example, to submit a
    Curriculum Vitae (CV) rather than a conventional resume for an
    academic job.  To learn more about the difference between a CV and a
    resume, study “The Graduate Student and Post-Graduate Resume”
    section and the sample link to view each type of resume.  You will
    also benefit from a list of common action words used to describe
    your job experience.  This chapter also covers the topics for
    subunits 1.2 and 1.3, as well as any inclusive sub-subunits.

     Instructions: Read this article, which explains common mistakes in
    resume writing and teaches how to format resumes for web-based and
    paper-based applications. One common mistake is to assume that there
    is only one correct layout or format for a resume. A chronological
    resume is more traditional and lists job titles and dates in reverse
    chronology (most recent/current job first). A skills resume
    emphasizes your strengths by combining activities from various
    sources of experience, for example, school, paid jobs, volunteer
    work, etc. Your decision as to what format to use for a given target
    job will depend on your work history and the nature of your desired
    position. The article also specifies information to include in
    various parts of your resume. Note that this reading also covers
    topics outlined in sub-subunits 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 as well as subunits
    1.3, 2.1, and 2.2.
