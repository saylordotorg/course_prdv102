Course Syllabus for "PRDV102: Resume Writing "
----------------------------------------------

Are you getting ready to apply for a job, or are you already seeking
employment?  A resume (or résumé) is a brief written account of
personal, educational, and professional qualifications and experience
that you prepare as part of your application materials for a prospective
job.  To ensure that your resume is read by the recipient, you will need
a cover letter that markets your unique qualifications for the specified
job description.  In the current global economy, it is essential for job
seekers to optimize their chances of being considered and hired for
positions that are well-suited to their qualifications and interests. 
This course will help you effectively develop employment application
materials for today’s job market by honing your resume writing skills,
providing you with tools to create an impressive resume (or to improve
the one you already have), and giving suggestions on developing an
effective cover letter.  You will study different types of resume and
cover letter formats that can be applied to various prospective
employment situations and your own personal career goals.  You will
undertake a critical assessment of the professional skills you already
possess, brainstorm and apply the best ways to market these skills in
your resume and cover letter, and enhance your application materials by
using specific tips and techniques to make you more competitive for the
job you seek.  By the end of this course, you will combine effective
language and design elements to produce a polished resume and cover
letter that can be tailored to each specific job application.
